        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at the National University of Modern Languages, where I'm honing my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology.

            My journey in the realm of Computer Science has been an exciting one, and I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of programming languages, including C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and Python. Teaching these languages has been a passion of mine, and I find immense satisfaction in helping others unlock their potential in the world of coding.
            
            But my interests extend beyond the lines of code. I'm also a fervent graphic designer with a knack for creating visually captivating content. Whether it's crafting eye-catching infographics, designing dynamic presentations (PPTs), or crafting compelling flyers, I thrive in the realm of graphic design.
            
            As a part-time freelancer, I've had the privilege of turning my passion for graphic design into a profession. Collaborating with clients from diverse industries has allowed me to expand my creative horizons and deliver tailored solutions that make a lasting impact.
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the fusion of my programming skills and design aesthetics come to life. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch. Let's create something remarkable together!
            
            Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you.
